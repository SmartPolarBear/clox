# CLOX
Interpreter and compiler implemented in modern C++ for the lox programing language described in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) with extensions in grammars and other features. 

In a long run, this project will support compile to binary and JIT with LLVM.

### Built With
#### Environment
This project is built with  

- MSVC 17.0
- CMAKE, 3.19 and above.

**Note:** C++20 support of compilers, especially support for `std::format` and concepts are required for compiling most of the codes. Now, only Visual Studio 16.9 and above are known to support them all. And LLVM 13 may work because it claims its test formatting features are "In progress". Also for this reason, only releases for Windows is provided for the present.  

#### Third-party Libraries
- [microsoft/GSL](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL)  
- [p-ranav/argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse)  
- [google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)  

## Usage  
`clox` to enter REPL mode.    
`clox --file <source file>` to run a file.  

## Roadmap  

|Naive CLOX|Typed CLOX|CLOXc
|----------|----------|---------|
‚úÖ Basic language features<br><br> **Release: [First preview version of clox interpreter](https://github.com/SmartPolarBear/clox/releases/tag/v0.1.0)**  |  ‚úÖ Extended language features (Mainly OOP) <br> üîÑ Full test coverage <br> üîÑ Refined REPL experience <br> ‚ùå Introduce the LOX standard library | ‚ùå Make CLOX a static-typed language. A dynamic subset of lox will be available as well. <br> ‚ùå Compile Typed-CLOX to binary executable with LLVM <br> ‚ùå Complete implementation of LOX standard library |

‚úÖ Supported | üîÑ In progress | ‚ùå In plan  

## Documentation  

Here is a hand-on quick instruction. Refer to [Documentation for extended LOX language (not exist yet)]() for details.  

### Variables and Constants  
```
var a=10; // it's a variable
a=20; // variable can be reassigned
```

### Built-in `print` Statement  
```
var a=10;
print a; // 10
print a=20; // 20, a's value will be 20 afterwards.
```
