# CLOX
Interpreter and compiler implemented in modern C++ for the lox programing language described in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) with extensions in grammars and other features. 

In a long run_code, this project will support compile to binary and JIT with LLVM.

### Built With
#### Environment
This project is built with  

- MSVC 17.0
- CMAKE, 3.19 and above.

**Note:** C++20 support of compilers, especially support for `std::format` and concepts are required for compiling most of the codes. Now, only Visual Studio 16.9 and above are known to support them all. And LLVM 13 may work because it claims its test formatting features are "In progress". Also for this reason, only releases for Windows is provided for the present.  

#### Third-party Libraries
- [microsoft/GSL](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL)  
- [p-ranav/argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse)  
- [Neargye/magic_enum](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum)  
- [google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)    

## Usage  
`clox` to enter REPL mode.    
`clox --file <source file>` to run_code a file.

## Major Changes from Original LOX  

To extend the language and equip it with type system, several changes in grammar are made.

### Type System  

#### Vision of the Type System

|Feature|Status|
|-------|------|
|Primitive types like `integer`|‚úÖ|
|Class types|‚úÖ|
|Basic type checking|‚úÖ|
|Union type and nullable type|üîÑ|
|Checks for nullability|‚ùå|  

#### Changes from Original LOX

**Variables** should be either declared with a type, or initialized by a type-deducible initializer:
```
var val1:integer; 
var val2=1+1;
```
**Functions** and **Methods** should be either declared with a type, or simple enough for return type to be deduced. All parameters, unlike variables, should be declared with a type.  
A common situation where return type is impossible to be deduced is that a recursive call appear before any `return` statement.
```
fun hello() // type deduced: void
{
   print "hello";
}

fun hello2(a:integer) // type deduced: integer
{
   return a+2*a;
}

fun fib(a:integer)  // type deduced: integer
{
  if(a==1 or a==2)
  {
    return 1;
  }
  
  return fib(a-1)+fib(a-2);
}

fun too_complex(d:integer) // ERROR: too complex for return type deducing
{
   if(d==10)
   {
      print "fin";
   }
   too_complex(d+1);
}

```

### Class  
Now, methods, operator methods and variables can appear in class declaration. Unlike original LOX language, a new keyword, `constructor` is introduced to define a constructor. Furthermore, keyword `operator` is introduced to define operator methods. Note that not every operator can be defined by it.  
Another key different is that `fun` keyword is now required for methods.  

```
class Person {
  var name:string;

  constructor(n:string) {
    this.name=n;
  }

  constructor(n1:string,n2:string) {
    this.name=n1+" "+n2;
  }

  fun sayName() {
    print this.name;
  }

  fun sayName(attach:string) {
    var msg=this.name+" "+attach;
    print msg;
  }

  operator==(another:Person):boolean {
    return this.name==another.name;
  }

}
```

## Documentation

Here is a hand-on quick instruction. Refer to [Documentation for extended LOX language (not exist yet)]() for details.

### Variables and Constants
```
var a=10; // it's a variable
a=20; // variable can be reassigned
```

### Built-in `print` Statement
```
var a=10;
print a; // 10
print a=20; // 20, a's value will be 20 afterwards.
```

// TODO
