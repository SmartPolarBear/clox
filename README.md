# CLOX
Interpreter and compiler implemented in modern C++ for the lox programing language described in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) with extensions in grammars and other features. 

In a long run, this project will support compile to binary and JIT with LLVM.

### Built With
#### Environment
This project is built with  

- MSVC 17.0
- CMAKE, 3.19 and above.

C++20 support, especially support for `std::format` and concepts are required for compiling most of the codes.  

#### Third-party Libraries
- [microsoft/GSL](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL)  
- [p-ranav/argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse)  
- [google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)  

## Usage  
`clox` to enter REPL mode.    
`clox --file <source file>` to run a file.  

## Roadmap  

|Naive CLOX|Typed CLOX|CLOXc
|----------|----------|---------|
‚úÖ Basic language features<br>  |  üîÑ Extended language features <br> üîÑ Make CLOX a static-typed language <br> ‚ùå Introduce the LOX standard library | ‚ùå Compile Typed-CLOX to binary executable with LLVM <br> ‚ùå Complete implementation of LOX standard library |

‚úÖ Supported | üîÑ In progress | ‚ùå In plan  

## Documentation  

Here is a hand-on quick instruction. Refer to [Documentation for extended LOX language (not exist yet)]() for details.  

### Variables and Constants  
```
var a=10; // it's a variable
a=20; // variable can be reassigned
```

### Built-in `print` Statement  
```
var a=10;
print a; // 10
print a=20; // 20, a's value will be 20 afterwards.
```

// TODO
